# nPacker
A CLI sprite packer made with Node.js, written in TypeScript. This program takes in a folder of .png files, packs them into a single .png file, and spits out a JSON file containing information where every .png file was placed. It also trims alpha padding off of each image in order to save space. This utility can especially be useful for game development when wanting to generate a sprite sheet.

## Installation
The installation process should be the same on every platform. First, make sure you have Node.js as well as npm installed. Then, to install the script globally (so it can be used from anywhere in your system), run:
```
git clone https://github.com/austin0209/npacker
cd npacker
npm install
npm run build
npm install -g
```
That's it! If everything ran successfully, you can simply run ```npack``` from anywhere in your system!

## Input
The first parameter passed into nPacker without a preceding "-" or "--" will be treated as the folder of images to scan. nPacker will search the directory as well as all subdirectories and use all the images it finds. It will automatically ignore all file types that it doesn't support, so the directory you give it does not need to exclusively have image files!

## Output
nPacker will output two files: a .png file and a JSON file. By default the names of these files are "result.png" and "result.json" respectively. These files are saved in the current working directory by default. The file name as well as the output path can be configured by optional parameters, as specified below.

## Usage
```
usage:  npack <path to image folder> [optional params]
availiable parameters:
        {-h --help}:
                open this dialogue.
        {-o --output} <path to directory>:
                set folder to output to, must be an existing directory.
                default: current working directory.
        {-f --filename} <name>:
                set filename of outputs (filename.png, filename.json). do not include the file extension here.
                default: "result"
        {-b --border} <integer value>:
                set space between each sprite.
                default: 0
        {-n --notrim}:
                if used, transparent padding will not be trimmed. can be useful if the script is too slow.
```
